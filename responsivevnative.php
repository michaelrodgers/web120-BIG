 <h2 class="pageID">Responsive Site vs Native App</h2>
        <p>Alexa Internet is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides web traffic data and analytics from around the globe.  They provide a ranking system that defines the top 500 most trafficked sites on the Internet.  The top 20 websites on this list (and the majority of all the websites listed) have at least one thing in common; they also offer their services in the form of a mobile app (Alexa).</p>
        <p>      These differ from responsive websites.  Responsive websites run through a browser, but native applications are downloaded onto the device itself through a distributor like Google Play or the Apple Store (Murillo).  Choosing which, or if both, are right for your client depends on their specific needs.</p> 
        <p>      Responsive websites usually require a lot less upfront investment in terms of the time and skills necessary to deploy because much of the backend development is taken care of by the browser (Ta).  If the site requires information to update frequently or if the app is monetized based on advertising traffic, a responsive website is probably the preferred route (Murillo).  Native apps can still connect and cache information, but responsive websites will connect to the host servers when loaded and do not have to deal with the restrictions that certain app distributors place on advertising methods.</p> 
        <p>      However, native apps specific to a series of devices can be customized to make better use of a device’s components that not all browsers can access, like a camera, gyroscope, or specified databases like contact lists (Interaction Design).  They can function without a network connection and tend to be faster since do not rely on server requests/responses for every action (Ta).  Although CSS3 offers animation options for mobile apps, native apps offer a wider variety of capabilities in this area as well.</p> 
        <p>      Generally, the recommendation I would make for most clients would be to create both but to focus on a responsive site first.  It’s typically easier and faster to develop and gets the brand out to the public as quickly as possible.  The responsive site can then be used as a base layout to develop a native app as you identify UX limitations from the browsers.  The notable exception to this would be gaming apps or any platform that requires extensive, dynamic user interaction.</p>

        <p>E-commerce is a powerful tool for any business.  Overnight it releases you from th limitations of your geography and allows you to sell to a global market.</p> 
        <p>However, it is also a major liability.  Handling any kind of financial transaction online opens the potential for criminals to exploit the data you collect.  Cyber security teams need to defend against every possible vulnerability because even one successful method of entry is enough to due massive amounts of harm to your business and clientele.  It’s not enough to successfully protect your data from all currently-known threats, you still need to constantly maintain and update your security to deal with unknown, future tactics and to ensure compliance with changing national and international laws.</p>  
        <p>For that reason, it’s recommended that most online business use an outside service for handling transactions (Secure Shopping Cart).  Not only is this more secure, but most ecommerce sites provide tools that make integrating their scripts and code incredibly simple.</p>
        <p>Still, not all e-commerce service are equal.  Here is a list of considerations for deciding on an e-commerce partner:</p> 
    <ol>
        <li>How do they charge for their services?  As mentioned above, e-commerce is labor-intensive and risky.  Any site claiming to offer that for free is highly suspicious, but not all services bill in the same manner.  If you expect that only a small portion of your business will be conducted online, it might be best to go with a service that charges a percentage of your sales.  If you expect many very expensive transactions, it’s probably better to find a service that charges a monthly flat rate. (Blum)</li>
        <li>What kind of support do they offer?  If your site is not functioning properly, you might be losing money.  A better service will offer some protection for if their site crashes from their end, but it might also be worth it to investing in a partner that offers technical support with the problems on your side.  (What is a Shopping Cart?)</li>
        <li>How frequent are service outages?  Do their servers ever run slow or does their code send a lot of error messages?  It’s a good idea to find other retailers who use them as partners and check out their customer reviews for for a sense of the common user experience. (Biddle)</li>
        <li>Do they offer any added features?  Some e-commerce partners offer additional like SEO support, help running targeted advertisements, heat maps of your site, or other analytics. (Meacham)</li>
        <li>What kind of templates do they offer, and are they customizable?  You can expect there to be some restrictions involved in integration, but it’s ideal when you can find a service that fits well with your business aesthetic. (Rigo)</li>
        <li>Is this service scalable?  With the increased popularity of cloud-based platforms this is becoming less and less of an issue, but as of today, some e-commerce business still have server-based storage and traffic limitations.</li>
